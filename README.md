# Florida Blue Shopping List

Suppose I wanted to create a web app that allowed me to produce a grocery shopping list. I should be able to add items with a freeform input to a list, and once I’ve acquired that item I should be able to move that item from the “need to buy” list to the “in my cart” list…this way I know what I’ve already got.
Create a React App which has a text input to accept names of products, once submitted the product name should appear in the “need to buy” list. Allow me to move items from “need to buy” to “in my cart” with whatever action you feel is best.

Programmatically this should take less than one hour. 
<hr>
The App should consist of at least: 

- [x]	Input Field
- [x]	Two Lists “in my cart” and “need to buy”
-	[x] Validation to ensure you don’t use the input field to add a product that is already in “need to buy” or “in my cart”
- [x]	A way to move an item from “need to buy” to “in my cart” 
-	[x] A way to move an item from “in my cart” back to “need to buy”
- [x] Feel free to style it as you see fit.
- [] Refactor into proper components.
